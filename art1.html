			<h2>The Republic Will Be Reorganized</h2>
			<img src="https://starwarsblog.starwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/palpatine.jpg">
			<p>The Declaration of a New Order was a proclamation made by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine in 19 BBY, first as an address to an Extraordinary Session of the Galactic Senate and then to the general populace. In it, he proclaimed himself Emperor of the galaxy, legalized the extermination of the Jedi Order, and outlined his vision of transforming the thenceforth-abolished Galactic Republic into his new Galactic Empire.

</p>The anniversary of the Declaration of a New Order was celebrated as Empire Day.</p>

<h4>Speech as seen on HoloNet</h4>

<p>The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated! Any collaborators will suffer the same fate. These have been trying times, but we have passed the test. The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger. The war is over. The Separatists have been defeated, and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning. In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society, which I assure you will last for ten thousand years. An Empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body and a sovereign ruler chosen for life. An Empire ruled by the majority, ruled by a new constitution!</p>
