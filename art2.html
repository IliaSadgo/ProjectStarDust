			<h2>Governor Pryce's vision of Lothal</h2>
			<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/b/b5/Arihnda_Pryce.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20190705000336">
			<p>"We want Lothal to be the center of this part of the Outer Rim. That means industry, mining, commerce, expanded youth and military academies... and a powerful navy presence to maintain it all. If Kintoni starts drawing away our ships, everything else will follow."</p>
			
			<p> The Empire drastically changed the appearance of Capital City, evicting large amounts of people and demolishing existing buildings to pave the way for Imperial-style structures, and overnight, large sectors of the city were depopulated. These actions were met with mass protests, which ensued in large-scale arrests and crackdowns, allowing the Empire to cement their leadership and eventually establishing a governorship. What began as a simple loan of credits and supplies quickly became a fully fledged occupation. The Empire soon began plundering the minerals from Lothal with no regard to the people, and the environment became heavily polluted as the skies became clouded in smog, and the rivers were filled with factory waste. </p>
